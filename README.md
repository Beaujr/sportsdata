SPORTDATA
==============

Plotting Albion Indoor Sports Leagues Data using HighCharts and Bootstrap
--------------

This is just a learning project that utilizes ganon.php to scrap html from http://app.sportsdata.com and plot the data
using HighCharts.js in a BootStrap layout

If you team is with SportsData but not Albion sports all you have to do is:
- change the line "loadCentreData(29);" to whatever ID you league ID is on sportsdata
